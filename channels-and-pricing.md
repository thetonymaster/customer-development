# Channels and Pricing Hypothesis

## Channels

### Ads

The strategy for ads will the following:

- Social networks: based on the profile of the possible clients, can be one specific ad for each one.
- Search engines: Keywords will be defined based on each of the customer profiles
(or personas) and also on the most popular searches related to server configuration
and management.  

### Meetups

One way to show the product directly is in a meetup with a topic related to devops.
This kind of channel can also add valuable information about the practices of the possible
customers. This channel can be also be considered as direct (in person) sales.

### Open Source Projects

Functions as an indirect way of advertising, since open source contributions are always
appreciated by the community. Not a principal way to approach customers.

### SEO

Organic searches should also bring incoming traffic. So high rankings with SEO should be achieved.

### Blogposts

Another indirect sales channel, posting regular content about the technologies we use and
best practices can bring traffic to our landing page and possibly some conversions.

### Direct Sales

This is more aimed to enterprise customers which may need a more accurate presentation
of the product and maybe some help integrating it into their process.
