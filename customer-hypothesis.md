# Customer and their problem

## Types of customers

The types of customers identified so far:

**Developer (end user)**: while the product might or might not be bought by end users, this will be the ones that will interact more with the platform.

**QA (end user)**: while in minor degree, they will interact with the environments created for testing.

**Decision Maker**: Has not been identified who this exactly is, but has come up several times that the end user is not the one that decides to buy a new product.

**Economic Buyer**: again, not identified who this exactly is, but agencies. have a person who manage the money and if it can be expended.

## Customer problems

1. I have problems to scale my infrastructure because it can be very complex.
2. I have problems to deploy my code because of the difference between package versions and environments.
3. I have problems to integrate a new team member into the development team because of the packages needed to install to have a complete development environment.
4. I have trouble to test my code because I don't have a test environment.
5. I have problems learning about infrastructure because the learning curve is to steep.
6. I have trouble learning about configuration managers because the learning curve is to steep.
7. I have trouble retaining clients that use configuration managers because I don't know to use them.  
8. I have trouble maintaining my servers secured because I don't know about hardening best practices.
9. I have trouble controlling attacks because I don't know the best security practices.
10. I have trouble replicating my infrastructure due to the dependencies and configurations in development.
11. I have trouble migrating my infrastructure to another provider because I cannot replicate easily my server configuration.
12. I have problems managing the infrastructure's hardware because I have no way to monitor easily my servers.
13. I have trouble managing my clients because I don't have an specialist in infrastructure.
14. I have high infrastructure costs because I prefer to pay rather than my servers to fail.
15. I have high infrastructure costs because only AWS offers the flexibility I need.
16. I have trouble testing because I don't have the necessary infrastructure.
17. I have trouble adding new features to my solutions because I need to add the infrastructure guy if we can deploy code to production.
