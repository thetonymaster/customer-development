# Market Type

## Re-segmenting an Existing Market

It's when you enter an existing market, but you add a special feature or characteristic
to your product, so is the same kind as the one that alrady exists but yours differentiates,
to make a re-segmentation first you have to answer several questions, such as:
- What existing markets are customers coming from?
- What are the unique characteristics of those customers?
- What compelling needs of those customers are unmet by existing suppliers?

We migth this model if we were to enter in a global market, because there already
companies that offer services similar to ours, but this is not posible in a local approach.

## Entering a New Market

A new market is defined like follows: when there are not similar products to the
one you are offering, an you can't find other companies with comparable products.
Locally we could be aproaching anew market because companies of our sort are not yet
reaching our local market.
