# Market Type

## Re-segmenting an Existing Market

It's when you enter an existing market, but you add a special feature or characteristic
to your product, so is the same kind as the one that already exists but yours differentiates,
to make a re-segmentation first you have to answer several questions, such as:
- What existing markets are customers coming from?
- What are the unique characteristics of those customers?
- What compelling needs of those customers are unmet by existing suppliers?

We might this model if we were to enter in a global market, because there already
companies that offer services similar to ours, but this is not possible in a local approach.

The reason we could be re-segmenting a new market is because we are offering a product
that is more of a swiss army knife for small and medium companies that do not have a
person that is solely dedicated to devops tasks. Most of the services are offered by several
companies but they are scattered.

Examples of this are the following
- Amazon Elastic Beanstalk
- Heroku

## Entering a New Market

A new market is defined like follows: when there are not similar products to the
one you are offering, an you can't find other companies with comparable products.
Locally we could be approaching anew market because companies of our sort are not yet
reaching our local market.

The Latin American region is beginning to adopt the cloud based services, which may give us
an edge over existing products.
